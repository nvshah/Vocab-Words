Good Para : 

like all rivers the river ahead of us already exists before we arrive there. In the same way the future already exists now.
Not in a pre-determined sense but at least as some potentiality. As we arrive at the future moment our arrival marks the 
passage from the fluid form that we call future to the definitive solid form that we experience as the past.
We do not create time by passing through it; we simply freeze it in its tracks.
