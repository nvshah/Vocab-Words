3] The Non-Locality of Self

   Personal Trasformation : mind shapes our perception of reality
                            So We could change our experience of reality by altering our minds.

   Reality : It is not fixed that we exist in & don't have to take as given. 
             It can be altered and creative role is own to us.
             This insight is heart & Soul of Conscious Evolution

             It is much bigger than what previously thought

Our spiritual awakenings and realizations confront us with an experience of a reality that lies beyond our current perception. 

4] Science - Spirituality Conflicts

   Facts vs faith based,  Analytical & Moral Network ( 2 suppress each other ), theoritaical vs practical

   -> Believe in religion, spiritual - empathic feelings, concerns & views

   analytical thinking : disbelief in spiritual/religious idea. Why ?
                          faith requires disengagement of brain networks

   Moral thinking : correlated with meditation, doing prayer

   Religion & Science,actually are different kind of insight
   
  Taking a leap of faith involves shutting down brain regions involved in analytic reason
