Solitude - fulfilled being alone 
I have goal in my mind & I can justify it

When you have nuance of the things you are chasing, then you will get appreciated by yourself

Today's wild dream may be tomorrow's kitchen appliance

My Solitude is Dance

Realization of fact that you are suffering is No looking back

You are not a being that is aware, you are the awareness itself

Life is a bit of Sparkle
Life is brief Sparkle
When smiting is needed we will do as if needed
Just be alive to its fullest possible level
Miserable People have very long life (unless Joyful People)

Time is very relative experience

Are you Spinning the planet

Dont Constipate yourself with too many ideas, thoughts

Joyful & Alive
Willing to do more when you are happy
