Try to Distanced yourself from your inner (inherent) stupidity & it will collapse by itself

To become wise or to be wounded from given situation is your choice
Conscious Response vs Compulsive Reactions

If you want to know what will happen tomorrow
One thing might happen to you is You'll not play today's game well !
& eventually it ends up you as a Match Fixer 
Just allow yourself to commence where you want to Go, Without any external influences.
(Sadhguru)
